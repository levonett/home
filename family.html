         My grandmother always wants to feed me (and Iâ€™m mostly in favor of that), and she's one of the sweetest people. I have two sisters and a brother,
          and i'm the oldest so I have a lot of responsibilities. One of my sisters is very organized and the other is the opposite.
           They are both really friendly and everyone loves them. My brother, on the other hand, is the one who annoys me as we share a room.
           He can be really sweet when he wants to, but he mostly doesn't want to be that sweet. I love my family and they are the best. I almost forgot,
           I have a cat too. Champy is the most playful cat I've seen. <img src="images/notredame.jpg" alt="notre dame"><img src="images/parade.jpg" alt="parade"></p><hr></td>
