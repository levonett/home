just to name a few. Also I traveled to many small cities in Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain and Armenia.</h2><h2>
Paris was beautiful and there were a lot of historical and admirable places. I've been to Paris several times and everytime I’m amazed.
 Brussels is also beautiful; it has a lot of fascinating places. My house in Brussels was in the city center. It is a small city, but very cosy, there are numerous restaurants, tourist attractions, and it is always crowded.
The restaurant's are famous for seafood, and French cuisine. Belgium french fries, waffles and chocolate as also on the table. Well, my favorite palace was an italian pizzeria at the end of
 our street, Ricotta & Parmesan. London is also captivating; it has a lot of history, but it also has new buildings, we had a chance to be in the city at night looking
 down from the London Eye was exquisite. I don’t remember going to Rome because I was a little kid, though my parents insist that I have been there and proved it by showing some nice photos…
 I bet it was beautiful. Amsterdam I don’t remember either, because I was small. Varadero was fun and really relaxing, I've been there twice and I love it there. Yerevan is breathtaking.
 There is so much ancient history in Armenia going back to 3000 years. Well, the most loved city for me remains Barcelona. It has a warm climate with a lot of gorgeous historical places and great beaches.
 I loved everything about it and I enjoyed every second of it. Though to be honest, my favourite soccer team is there. I have traveled a lot, but I would still like to travel more and see places.
